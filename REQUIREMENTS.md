Option 1: Wiki Map
A web app that allows users to collaboratively create maps which list multiple "points", for example: "Best Places to Eat Around Town", "Locations of Movie Scenes".

Requirements:

users can see a list of the available maps
users can view a map
a map can contain many points
each point can have: a title, description, and image
authenticated users can create lists
authenticated users can modify lists (add, edit, remove points)
users can favorite certain lists
users have profiles, indicating their favorite lists and lists they've contributed to
use http://leafletjs.com/ or https://developers.google.com/maps/
Extensions:

lists have an edit history (see Wikipedia for reference)
lists can be rolled back (see Wikipedia for reference)
allow users to add URL links to points (ex. youtube videos or spotify songs), and use embed.ly to embed them
add the ability to have private lists (which only certain users can see and edit)
make the app work well on mobile
add unit tests (using mocha + chai)
add end-to-end tests (using phantomjs)
